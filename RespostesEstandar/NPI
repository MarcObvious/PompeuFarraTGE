I don't know what are you talking about
this doesn't make sense at all
I wish you could articulate a normal sentence
Oh my gosh why always the people who talks me is not literate at all
I don't get the point of that
Have you ever thought before talking?
I will simply act as you are not here, until you start taking this seriously, fine?
come on... What if you try to get me out of here and then I'll get you some beer?
booohhh, please say something that can be understood by a human being
lalalalala I am not getting anything, please try to communicate yourself better...
I think you should improve your grammar so people can read the nosenses you are typing
WTF man! You're not even trying!
